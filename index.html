            <img src="images/Pet/ash/ash_being_pet.jpeg" width = "400" alt="ash_being_pet">

            <p>Ash is a black cat that roams my apartment hallways. He's somehow always ready to greet me or my roommate and likes to run down the stairs to say Hi.</p> 
            <P>If we're not fast enough, he will run into our apartment and hide somewhere. Ash won cutest pet for our apartments, and I'm inclined to agree.</P>

            <h2>Pluto</h2>
            <img src="images/Pet/pluto/pluto.jpg" width = "400" alt="pluto_being_pet">

            <p>Pluto is a five year old rescue dog of an unknown breed. He was found wandering alone and taken to the Valley Humane Society where he found his new family. From a young age, Pluto always had a special personality, he was known for being very very lazy! He spends most of his time staring out the window to keep watch of his house. Don’t let the laziness fool you because Pluto defends his family from the mailman and squirrels every single day.</p> 
            <P>Aside from his job as defender of the house, Pluto likes to have fun. Pluto’s favorite part of the day is his daily walk. Sometimes he even gets to go to the park and meet his neighbors. He also loves his toy duck, and only his toy duck. As a dog, it's in his nature to hunt and so he makes sure to get some practice with his toy duck.
            </P>

            <img src="images/Pet/Fitz/Fitz.jpeg" width = "400" alt="Fitz_being_pet">

            <p>Loves chasings tennis balls, chipmunks, squirrels, and birds. Often found sitting by the fire in wintertime, and in sun patches when available. He’s energetic, mischievous, and easily bored. He loves people and gets grumpy if left without a lap too long. 
            </p> 
            <P>Loves barking up trees, running around on the lawn, and digging in the dirt looking for moles. He especially likes getting treats and whines when he comes inside and doesn’t get a snack. 
            </P>

            <p>Cody is a 7yr old Pembroke Corgi. He was born in Cavalier Farms, Seattle. He prefers to spend his days lounging on the bean bag. Every day, he enjoys two walks around the neighborhood and likes to make friends with other doggie friends. If lucky enough, he might see the cyclist, but he is not allowed to give chase.
            </p> 
            <P>Cody loves traveling. He enjoys walking on the beach and taking sun naps. But he hates cold weather. He would like to stay at home lounging by the fireplace in winter.
            </P>

            <h2>Juno</h2>
            <img src="images/Pet/Juno/juno_profile.JPG" width = "400" alt="Juno_being_pet">

            <p>
                No one knows exactly what breed Juno is, but that makes him all the more special. He was adopted before he was one year old; despite this and his German shepherd-esque looks, he stayed close to the same size, hovering around 50 lbs into adulthood. At the weathered age of ten years old, Juno is dealing with hip problems, but manages to stay in good spirits.
            </p> 
            <P>
                One of Juno’s favorite pastimes is finding the dirtiest puddle within a one-mile radius and making sure every inch of him makes contact with said puddle. If rolling around in dirt was an Olympic sport, Juno would have been the one that facilitated its inclusion into the Olympics.
            </P>

            <p>
                Brul is a 2yr old Maine coon cat. She prefers to spend his days lying in the bed. She enjoys watching outside from the window as long as there are no loud noises and bugs outside.
            </p> 
            <P>
                Brul loves walks on the beach and taking sun naps on a warm summer day. Brul is a playful cat but enjoys having slow, relaxed days at the same time. She hates grooming and bathing.
